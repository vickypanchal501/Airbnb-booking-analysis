## Project Summary
Airbnb is an American Company since 2007, it is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales.

We have our dataset from AirBnb based on NY. NY is amongst the most expensive places to live in USA. We would like to perform an in-depth analysis on one of the most densely populated cities of world. Our dataset is feature rich containing, location with co-ordinates, prices, host name, room types, availability throughout season. From these features we’ve tried to extract information like most expensive places to live in NY, is location really varies with occupancy rate, what type of room people tends to choose most, is there any particular season for tourists or locale when we can follow a surge in prices or occupancy rate of properties etc.
